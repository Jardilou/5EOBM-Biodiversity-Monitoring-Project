# 5EOBM-Biodiversity-Monitoring-Project
The Biodiversity Monitoring Project course builds on prior knowledge of signal processing and analog filtering. It aims to develop students’ ability to design, implement, and validate digital signal processing systems, with a specific focus on filtering methods, an essential field in many industrial and technological applications (telecommunications, audio and acoustics, instrumentation, biomedical engineering, industrial control, …). 
The project focuses on a signal processing application for biodiversity monitoring.
